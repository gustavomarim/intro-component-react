## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) - Find and fix JS problems


### What I learned

In this project I was able to put into practice my learning in React, using concepts of good software development practices, reuse of library components, semantic HTML and responsive CSS. I also had the opportunity to implement a project standardization with ESLint and validation of form fields through Regex.

### Continued development

Continuarei aperfei√ßoando as t√©cnicas de boas pr√°ticas de desenvolvimento de software, utiliza√ß√£o de react na constru√ß√£o de aplica√ß√µes e boas pr√°ticas de UI/UX.
